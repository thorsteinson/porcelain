Porcelain: A Project Breakdown
=========

Project Description
-------------------

The goal of this project was to work together as a team and create a non-trivial Android Mobile Application, drawing on the skills
and experiences of working with the Android SDK over the course of a quarter.

Our idea was to draw on our collective Android development and create an application that would allow users to find the best bathroom near them,
that fit certain criteria. Thus Porcelain was born.

To help drive development of this project. We brainstormed and gathered a series of user stories that we could use to drive development of our project forward.
With this guided focus, we have built an application that we are not only proud of, but one that meets our initial user stories as well.

The Technology
--------------

This project uses the Android Mobile GPS, along with Google Location Service, Map Service to gather user data and provide data to be stored.
Firebase is leveraged as our backend to persist data across multiple users and user sessions.

Porcelain was developed by Caleb Thorsteinson, Allison Amaral, and Hiram Munn for the Informatics Android Development
course taught by Joel Ross, Winter Quarter 2016.
